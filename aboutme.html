 <p> My name is Jordan Raimey. Some of my favorite things to do are listen to music, play volleyball, watch Netflix and do my makeup.
  My favorite rappers are Drake, Young Thug, Tyler the Creator, Travis Scott and Migos. My instagram name is whateverjordan_. I created
  that username when I was in 7th grade because I'm always right and people never want to hear the truth, therefore they tell me,
  "Whatever, Jordan." a lot.

 <p> LIKES: everything chocolate, music, makeup, and sleep
 </p>
 <p> DISLIKES: liars, spaghetti, country music, homework

  <h2>REFLECTIONS:</h2>
 <p> 1) I'm trying to make my website accesible to others by making content that is appropriate for all.
  </p>
 <p> 2) Other people used templates to create their site. They also were creative with their backgrounds. They did it through research
    and utilizing the resources given to us.
  </p>
 <p> 3) I'm most proud of learning how to insert codes in different websites.
  </p>
  <h3>CORE4:</h3>
 <p> 1) VARIABLE - A variable is used to store values in your code. It defines a specific part of your code. 
  Example:
 <p> t = Turtle()
 <p> pink = 5
 <p> red = 35
 <p> Turtle, red and pink are all variables in my code, which helps avoid confusion while creating the code.
  </p>
 <p> 2) LOOPS - Loops are used to repeat a selected part of code.
 <p> Example: To use a for loop --> "for _ in range():"
 <p> To use a while loop --> "while _ :"
  </p>
 <p> 3) CONDITIONALS - Conditionals are used for "if" and "else" statements
  </p>
 <p> 4) FUNCTIONS - Functions are reusable code.
  </p>
 
   <h4>REFLECTION:</h4>
  <p> 1. A list is a group of elements on one line. It is useful for organization on your code.
  <p> 2. All of my groups were helpful and welcoming. They produced a comfortable enviroment which made me feel comfortable to ask questions and answer questions.
