 <p> My name is Jordan Raimey. Some of my favorite things to do are listen to music, play volleyball, watch Netflix and do my makeup.
  My favorite rappers are Drake, Young Thug, Tyler the Creator, Travis Scott and Migos. My instagram name is whateverjordan_. I created
  that username when I was in 7th grade because I'm always right and people never want to hear the truth, therefore they tell me,
  "Whatever, Jordan." a lot.
 </p>
 <p> LIKES: everything chocolate, music, makeup, and sleep
 </p>
 <p> DISLIKES: liars, spaghetti, country music, homework

  <h2>REFLECTIONS:</h2)
 <p> 1) I'm trying to make my website accesible to others by making content that is appropriate for all.
  </p>
 <p> 2) Other people used templates to create their site. They also were creative with their backgrounds. They did it through research
    and utilizing the resources given to us.
  </p>
 <p> 3) I'm most proud of learning how to insert codes in different websites.
